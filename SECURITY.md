# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are developed against the current extension version declared in
`ii42.control`. The package does not ship historical II-42 catalogs, payload
readers, or version-to-version upgrade SQL. Unsupported historical formats must
be rebuilt from their source relations. A qualified deployment of a compatible
current-format package can retain its indexes; stop PostgreSQL before replacing
a loaded shared-preload library and verify the catalog, binary, and model
contract together. For `psql_bm25s`, follow the side-by-side source-table
migration in [Migrating BM25 Indexes](docs/upgrading.md).

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability. Use the repository's
private GitHub security-advisory workflow and include:

- the affected II-42 and PostgreSQL versions;
- operating system and architecture;
- the smallest reproducible SQL or deployment sequence;
- expected and observed behavior;
- whether untrusted database roles can trigger the issue;
- any crash, data-integrity, privilege, or information-disclosure impact.

Maintainers will acknowledge the report, reproduce it in an isolated
environment, and coordinate disclosure after a fix and regression test are
available. Never include production credentials, model secrets, or private
corpus data in a report.

## Model Checkout Trust

Treat a configured model checkout as executable server configuration. Its
directory, `manifest.json`, and artifacts must be owned and writable only by
the PostgreSQL deployment administrator. II-42 verifies declared artifact
digests and fails closed when they change, but the manifest is the trust root
that declares those digests. Do not place a production checkout in a path
writable by application roles or untrusted operating-system users.
